<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>I love meeting people and trying to understand how humans think and act. Studying in Portugal and Hungary, working with kids, adults, and the elderly made me think outside of my biased box and understand users better.
    Now, I believe I’m a better problem-solver with the human-centered design skills and methods I’ve been learning while studying and working on design projects.</p>
