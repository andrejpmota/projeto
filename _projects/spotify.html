<h1>New Spotify Social Features</h1>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>Sometimes designers work with companies with an established identity. So how do they help them innovate?<p>
</p>By bringing new perspectives, ideas and, mainly, by creating new features for the product. Thus designers help brands stand out and keep up with what people want and need. We took a deeper look at Spotify and decided to spice it up.</p>

<h2>Why Spotify</h2>
</p>Spotify is the most popular music and podcast streaming platform in the world. It focuses on giving a simple and intuitive experience of listening and finding music.</p>
<p>Despite allowing users to follow their friends and see what theyâ€™re listening to, the platform has not developed much further in this social field, which we believe has a lot of potential.</p>
<p>To make this platform more social without forgetting its main goal implies thinking of this interaction between friends to be about sharing music.</p>

<br>
<h3>What if we could share songs with our friends more easily, without needing another social network?</h3>
