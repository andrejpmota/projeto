        <h1>PLANTOME</h1>
        <h2>The Brand</h2>
        <p>PLANTOME is a Portuguese brand associated with a concept store based in Lisbon.</p>
        <p>It's the welcoming place where all the indoor plants and accessories transport us to the very current concept of the urban jungle, or the traditional Portuguese Winter Garden.</p>
        <p>The main elements here are the large indoor plants and climbing plants, which coexist with traditional and contemporary pieces, made by young artists. Everything is connected by nature, botanic, art and design.</p>

        <h2>Online Presence</h2>
        <h3>Website</h3>
        <p>I designed PLANTOME’s online shop with 3 specific goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The interface must be clean and appealing;</li>
            <li>The navegation must be intuitive;</li>
            <li>Users should be able to find the perfect plant for them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instagram</h3>
        <p>I make sure PLANTOME has a strong presence on Instagram, posting stories everyday and new posts twice a week, showcasing new products or projects we are developing.</p>
        <p>In 6 months, I was able to increase 80% of PLANTOME’s followers on instagram, compared to the direct competing brand.</p>
        <p>The process was organic, made with engagement skills and with no paid ads.</p>
