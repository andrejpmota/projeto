    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>I'm André Mota and I was born in Lisbon, Portugal. I had my BA in "Communication Design" in the Fine-Arts Faculty of the University of Lisbon and I'm currently studying "Digital Experience Design", a Post-graduate course in the same faculty.</p>
    <p>I love meeting people and trying to understand how humans think and act. Studying in Portugal and Hungary, working with kids, adults, and the elderly made me think outside of my biased box and understand users better.</p>
    <p>Now, I believe I’m a better problem-solver with the human-centered design skills and methods I’ve been learning while studying and working on design projects.</p>
